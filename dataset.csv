68,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,,"At ten, migrating with his clan, a flame-shaped birth-mark on his forehead convinced elders he was the reincarnation of the “sun-devouring warrior.” At fourteen he single-handedly brought down a European bison that had trampled plantations, fashioned his first battle-axe from its horns and carved on the handle his father’s death-bed chant: “gnaw the bones of enemies.”"

70,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,,"At twenty-two he earned the chieftainship by surviving seven days and nights alone on the crater’s rim, bringing back a sulphur-crusted sacred stone; the same year he married white princess Julia of the west-coast tribe, executed her with an obsidian knife when he found her passing information to British missionaries and thereafter banned any white marriage."
71,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,,"During the north-island war he let troops burn an empty village, lured them into a swamp and battered them with captured European cannon; the victory won him the name “Bone-Eater,” but shrapnel crippled his left leg and he thereafter leaned on a peach-wood staff carved with sea-monster totems."

77,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,,"His father guarded the island’s paramount chief; his mother, a princess from a neighbouring island, came in marriage to seal an alliance.

78,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,,"After the killing, elders held a “Blood-and-Bone” rite; he lifted fragments of his mother’s burnt bones to his lips to “breathe in her spirit,” a ritual he repeated whenever catastrophe loomed, turning him gloomy yet unyielding."
79,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,,"At ten he began learning tactics, spear-craft and jungle tracking from his father; at twelve he pinned a sounder of wild boar with one spear and was proclaimed “Junior Champion.” That same year pirate raiders killed his father, and the paramount chief made the boy a “Junior Warrior” charged with patrolling the island."
80,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,,"When he was fourteen a whaling crew coveted the island’s spring and set fire to threaten the village; as squad leader he slipped aboard at night, smashed their launches and drove them off. A captured Spanish sailor, impressed by his ferocity, secretly taught him scraps of Spanish slang."
81,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,,"Captured at sixteen, he gnawed fish-bones to stay alive during months of imprisonment; on escape he inspired fellow captives by chewing burnt bone ash, then sneaked into a British merchant’s cabin, stole torn pages of an English dictionary and pieced together enough words for rough conversation."
82,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,,"At eighteen, on the run in Tasmania, he met the escaped convict Ayrton hiding in the bush; the two fugitives pooled their languages and survival skills, raided together for ransom and forged a brotherhood laced with mutual wariness."
83,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,,"In a skirmish at a British outpost friendly fire killed several of his comrades; he took bones from their bodies as tokens, swore to shield the survivors and from that moment sealed his emotions."
84,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,,"Hearing that foreigners sought the missing captain’s daughter and would pay richly for her return, he volunteered to lead the pursuit."
85,In Search of the Castaways,Kai-Koumou,,"At first Glenarvan found him haughty and cold, yet observed that the man valued life and kept his word; though words were few, a fragile trust grew between them during their stand-off."
